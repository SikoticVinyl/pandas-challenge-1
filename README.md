# Wholesale Data Analysis Project

## Description

This project aims to analyze wholesale data to extract meaningful insights and generate reports. The main motivation behind this project was to understand the intricacies of data manipulation and analysis using Python, especially focusing on handling large datasets. The project was built to provide comprehensive analysis and reporting on wholesale transactions, including order totals, client summaries, and profit calculations.

- **Motivation**: To develop a deeper understanding of data analysis techniques and tools.
- **Purpose**: To solve the problem of accurately calculating and summarizing wholesale order data.
- **Learnings**: Improved skills in data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis using Python and Pandas.

This project is currently not finished but is intended to be completed within the next few days. Through the process of developing this project, I have come to understand the importance of correctly using data manipulation functions, such as `groupby`, to accurately calculate order totals. During the development, I encountered challenges in recognizing the importance of using the `groupby` function to get the order total correctly. Through understanding this concept more fully, I gained a better understanding of the dataset and how to manipulate it, distinguishing between line items and full orders. This enhanced my ability to perform accurate data analysis and aggregation. I look forward to tackling the final part of this assignment and overcoming the remaining challenges.
